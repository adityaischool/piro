The concept of data ownership and privacy is still foreign to many common users. Applications enabling data privacy are often technical (ex. GPG Tools) and are not always user-friendly, requiring several steps to implement. Through our application, _____, we aim to make the concept of data ownership more accessible to the common user through a friendly, enjoyable, and familiar interface. Our application automatically “bakes in” a higher level of data privacy using Blockchain technology, exposing users to a new standard and level of data ownership without requiring technical skill and knowledge.

Similar applications, such as ad-blocking plugins like Ghostery and Ad Blocker, have introduced concepts of data privacy to the mass market through automatic ad blocking. These applications give users the immediate benefit of an ad-free browsing experience and have slowly educated users on the importance of withholding personal data from ad networks and corporations.
